This is an on-going project in C++ where I am trying to implement various Data Structures so that I can
sharpen my alorithimic thinking and develop an good understanding of data structures. So far, I have implemented
Singly and Doubly Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues (although some of those still need improvements).

## Implemented Methods in the Classes SL_List (Singly Linked List) and DL_List (Doubly Linked List)

* Insert(Value, Ins_Mode (optional), Index (optional)): Inserts a node with the data stored "value" in the list.
* Delete(Index): Deletes the Node at index "Index" from the list.
* Print(Mode): Presents (Prints) the list in several different modes ('F': Full Print, 'V': Values Only, 'L': Locations Only).
* Is_Sorted(): Returns true or false on whether the list is sorted.
* Is_Empty(): Returns true or false on whether the list is empty.
* Does_Contain(Value): Returns true or false on whether the list contains a node with the value "Value".
* Reverse(): Reverses the order of the list.
* Swap(position_1, position_2): Swaps the order of two nodes at indices position_1 and position_2.
* Clear(): Clears the list.
